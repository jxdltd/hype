We provide a helpful Better Auth plugin that lets you control access to your app based on whether a prospect has been granted access or not.

## Install `@buildhype/better-auth`

```bash
npm install @buildhype/better-auth
```

## Setup

In your server file add the following:

```ts
import { hypePlugin } from "@buildhype/better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [hypePlugin({ apiKey: "your-secret-api-key" })],
});
```

Now you can grant access to a prospect or batch in the dashboard allowing them to sign up while all other users are prevented from doing so.
