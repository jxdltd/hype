description: Easily add a waitlist to your React application.
---

Our headless React components allow you to easily add a waitlist in a few lines of code while keeping full control over the UI.

To get started you'll need to get a public API key from the [Hype](https://www.buildhype.dev/) dashboard.

## Install `@buildhype/react`

```bash
npm install @buildhype/react
```

## Setup

```tsx
import {
  Waitlist,
  WaitlistEmail,
  WaitlistSubmit,
  WaitlistSuccess,
} from "@buildhype/react";


export function App() {
  return (
    <Waitlist apiKey="your-api-key">
        <WaitlistEmail />
        <WaitlistSubmit>Join Waitlist</WaitlistSubmit>
        <WaitlistSuccess>
        Thank you for joining the waitlist!
        </WaitlistSuccess>
    </Waitlist>
  );
}
```

## Styling

Here's an example from the [Hype](https://www.buildhype.dev/) website using Tailwind.

```tsx
import {
  Waitlist as HypeWaitlist,
  WaitlistEmail,
  WaitlistSubmit,
  WaitlistSuccess,
} from "@buildhype/react";

export function Waitlist() {
  return (
    <HypeWaitlist
      className="flex gap-2 items-stretch"
      apiKey={import.meta.env.PUBLIC_HYPE_KEY}
    >
      <WaitlistEmail className="border border-neutral-700 p-2 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-neutral-500 text-sm" />
      <WaitlistSubmit className="bg-white text-black px-4 py-2 hover:bg-neutral-100 cursor-pointer text-sm">
        Join Waitlist
      </WaitlistSubmit>
      <WaitlistSuccess className="text-sm font-medium">
        Thank you for joining the waitlist!
      </WaitlistSuccess>
    </HypeWaitlist>
  );
}
```
