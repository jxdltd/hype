Our headless Svelte components allow you to easily add a waitlist in a few lines of code while keeping full control over the UI.

To get started you'll need to get a public API key from the [Hype](https://www.buildhype.dev/) dashboard.

## Install `@buildhype/svelte`

```bash
npm install @buildhype/svelte
```

## Setup

```svelte
<script>
  import {
    Waitlist,
    WaitlistEmail,
    WaitlistSubmit,
    WaitlistSuccess,
  } from "@buildhype/svelte";
</script>

<Waitlist apiKey="your-api-key">
  <WaitlistEmail />
  <WaitlistSubmit>Join Waitlist</WaitlistSubmit>
  <WaitlistSuccess>
    Thank you for joining the waitlist!
  </WaitlistSuccess>
</Waitlist>
```

## Styling

Here's an example from the [Hype](https://www.buildhype.dev/) website using Tailwind.

```svelte
<script>
  import {
    Waitlist,
    WaitlistEmail,
    WaitlistSubmit,
    WaitlistSuccess,
  } from "@buildhype/svelte";
  import { PUBLIC_HYPE_KEY } from '$env/static/public';
</script>

<Waitlist
  class="flex gap-2 items-stretch"
  apiKey={PUBLIC_HYPE_KEY}
>
  <WaitlistEmail class="border border-neutral-700 p-2 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-neutral-500 text-sm" />
  <WaitlistSubmit class="bg-white text-black px-4 py-2 hover:bg-neutral-100 cursor-pointer text-sm">
    Join Waitlist
  </WaitlistSubmit>
  <WaitlistSuccess class="text-sm font-medium">
    Thank you for joining the waitlist!
  </WaitlistSuccess>
</Waitlist>
```
