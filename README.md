## What is Hype?

Hype is an open-source platform for developers designed to help them go from 0 to 1 as easily as possible. Our goal is to create a modern set of unified tools that work seamlessly together.

- **Waitlists**: Integrate a waitlist into your product in minutes.
- **Referrals**: Setup a viral referral scheme designed to grow your user base.
- **CRM**: Powerful dashboard to manage your inbound interest.
- **Onboarding**: Full control over how and when you onboard your users.
- **Feedback**: Communicate with your users before and after your product is launched.

## Why use Hype?

- **Open-Source**: We believe in being fully transparent. We're not just selling you a tool, we're building a community.
- **Developer-First**: We believe in giving developers time to focus on their product. Integrating should take minutes, not hours.
- **Customisable**: Pre-launch features should match the look and feel of your product. We give you complete control over the UX.
- **Independent**: Hype is fully bootstrapped and we deliberately aren't chasing after venture capital. We believe our priorities are the users not the shareholders.
